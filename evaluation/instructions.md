## Pairwise Human Annotations

We provide two files containing the pairwise human annotations for 3B and 7B models: `3b_pairwise_annotations.csv` and `7b_pairwise_annotations.csv`. We also provide the results from computing automated metrics on our produced story-generations. We don't include the raw story-generations or analysis that relies on them, due to potential copyright issues.

From these files, you can use the `Evaluating Models.ipynb` notebook to compute the preference probabilities, win-rates, and automated metric tables from our paper.
